Provides the structures and methods to encrypt data with the Paillier
encryption scheme with thresholding.  This package a simplified
implementation of what is specified in the paper
<i>A Generalization of Paillier's Public-Key System with Applications to
Electronic Voting</i> by Damg&aring;rd et al.  Within this paper, the
authors generalize the Paillier encryption scheme to permit computations
modulo <i>n</i><sup><i>s</i>+1</sup>, allowing block length for encryption
to be chosen freely.  In addition to this undertaking, Damg&aring;rd et al.
also constructed a threshold variant of the scheme.

<p>

This package provides
the following features of the paper
<ul>
  <li>The degree of <i>n</i> is fixed to 1.</li>
  <li>A fully functional simple Paillier encryption scheme with separate
      key classes for easy keysharing.</li>
  <li>Proper Thresholding for an arbitrary number of decryption servers
      and threshold needed to decrypt.</li>
  <li>Non-interactive zero knowledge proofs to ensure proper encryption
      and decryption.</li>
</ul>

<p>

Of particular note, this implementation is simple as <b><i>s</i> is fixed
to be 1</b>.  This allows for simplicity at this stage of the design.  Further,
we hope to have added methods which would make the actual use of this package
to be easy and flexible.

<p>

Future features would include support for encrypting arbitrary length
strings/byte arrays to avoid padding issues.

      A Generalization of Paillier's Public-Key System with Applications to

      This is the primary implementation
      design for this package.
      <p>
      <b>Notice of typo:</b> There is a typo in the calculation of
      &lambda;<sub>0,<i>i</i></sub> on both pages 17 and 19.  The correct
      calculation of the Lagrange coefficient for interpolating the value of a
      polynomial is<br>
      &lambda<i><sup>S</sup><sub>j,i</sub></i>=&Delta;
       &Pi;<sub><i>i</i>'&isin;<i>S</i>\<i>i</i></sub>
        (<i>j</i>-<i>i</i><b>'</b>)/(<i>i</i>-<i>i</i>').<br>
      The error is that the numerator of the fraction is <i>j</i>-<i>i</i>' not
      <i>j</i>-<i>i</i>.  The corresponding calculation of
      &lambda;<sup><i>S</i></sup><sub>0,<i>i</i></sub> must be corrected
      accordingly.</li>
