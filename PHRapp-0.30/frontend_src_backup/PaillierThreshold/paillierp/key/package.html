Provides the structures for public and private keys for the use in the 
generalized Paillier encryption scheme with and without thresholding.  These
objects are merely structures to hold the necessary credentials for encryption
and decryption of data.  Each structure is built off of its public key.
For the actual setup of keys, look at {@link paillierp.key.KeyGen}.
<p>
Future features would include support for encrypting arbitrary length
strings/byte arrays to avoid padding issues.  Also, the KeyGen class should be
included as static methods in the respective keys.
